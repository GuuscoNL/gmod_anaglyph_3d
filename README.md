# Anaglyph 3D in Gmod!

Always thought you weren't immersed enough into Gmod? Don't have the money for a VR headset? Have I got the solution for you! You can now play Gmod in 'true' 3D with the most advanced technology from the 80s: **[Anaglyph 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D)**!

**This is not just a chromatic aberration effect!**  
Anaglyph 3D works by rendering the scene twice (once for each eye) from slightly different camera angles to simulate how our eyes perceive depth. The two images are then filtered through red and cyan channels and combined into a single frame. When viewed through red/cyan glasses, each eye sees only one of the images, creating a true stereoscopic 3D effect.

Unlike chromatic aberration addons, which simply shift colors around object edges to fake depth without actually rendering from two perspectives.

> **_Because the scene is rendered twice, expect your FPS to be roughly cut in half!_**
